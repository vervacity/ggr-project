>> k nearest
Gasperini et all Cell 2019 suggests that mostly 1st-3rd nearest gene, but mostly first or second nearest.

>> distance
100kb max dist since GTEx suggests eQTL distr falls off around 100kb (Gamazon et al Nature Genetics 2018)
Also note Gasperini et all Cell 2019 suggests median position of enhancers (crispr validated) is 25kb, ie 50% of all effective enhancers for a gene could be within 25kb.

So, 100kb is a good max and 25kb is a good min.
